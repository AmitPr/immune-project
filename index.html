                                You’ve probably heard of and gotten vaccinations in your life, but what exactly are vaccines? Vaccines are injections of specific molecules that appear on all pathogens. All pathogens have antigens, foreign molecules that the body’s immune system uses to recognize and destroy pathogens. Antigens are present on the surface of the pathogen’s membrane (surface layer), whether it is a bacteria or virus doesn’t matter but all different species of pathogens have different antigens. Vaccines train your body’s immune system to recognize and destroy these antigens, so that when a real infection occurs your body will already know how to beat it.

                            <p>
                            Vaccines were formally invented by Edward Jenner, a British physician, in 1796. Edward Jenner based his first vaccination, for the disease smallpox, on the practice of variolation developed in India and China. Variolation involves deliberately infecting healthy people with pathogens from someone who is already sick, but only has a mild case. This practice was based off of the idea that smallpox was observed to only infect people once in a lifetime. This created the idea of deliberately infecting people with the deadly smallpox, but with a milder infection originating from someone who had naturally gotten a mild infection. This did indeed create an immunity from smallpox.</p>
                            <p>    
                            Edward Jenner had observed that a infection of cowpox results in the host also developing immunity for smallpox. Taking into account the practice of variolation, Edward Jenner hypothesized that cowpox could be utilized to infect people and create an immunity for smallpox deliberately. Although this was a crude method to vaccinate, it worked and smallpox had become much less deadly.<br></p>
                            <p>
                            Much more work had to be done, this is where Louis Pasteur comes into the scene. Louis Pasteur was a genius who invented pasteurization, the process of heating beverages to kill bacteria. He disproved the spontaneous generation theory and researched vaccines, creating a field called immunology. Pasteur created the vaccine for anthrax, a disease that was killing sheep at the time. He performed a controlled experiment, and found that sheep injected with a weak virulent strain of the disease which Pasteur had developed. Those injected survived, while nearly all the sheep not vaccinated died. Later on he earned his reputation by also creating a vaccine for rabies, a disease transmitted by the bite of a dog.

                                Vaccines work differently depending on what type of vaccine they are. There are many different types of vaccines but all of them have the same goal; to train the body’s immune system to recognize and develop counters to specific antigens so that you can develop immunity to a pathogen. Different types of vaccines include:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Live Attenuated Vaccines</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Live Attenuated Vaccines contain weakened pathogens, so the immune system can easily learn to recognize that specific antigen without the risk of an actual infection. Because it now recognizes it, the next time that pathogen tries to attack, your immune system will recognize it and destroy it quickly. However, people with immunodeficiency diseases like HIV or SCIDS are at risk when taking vaccines because the immune system may be weakened to a point where even severely weakened pathogens are able to beat the immune system.
                            </p>
                            <ol start="2">
                                <li>Subunit Vaccines</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Subunit vaccinations are vaccinations that do not contain a pathogen at all. This type of vaccination only inject a pathogen’s antigens into the body. The body can detect these antigens and develop antibodies against it and recognize it. These vaccinations are advantageous because they do not run the risk of injecting live pathogen into the body, which when combined with an immunodeficiency disease could be harmful.
                            </p>
                                
                            <ol start="3">
                                <li>Inactivated Vaccines</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Inactive vaccinations are similar to live attenuated vaccines, however the microbes that reside in it are completely dead, and do not have any effect on the body other than to establish the immunity for that disease. It additionally shares the advantages that subunit vaccinations have.

                                    Diseases that are most affected by vaccines are those which only can have humans as hosts. This is because if all the humans that are able to be infected with the disease are vaccinated, then the disease will get eradicated. It will have no place to reproduce and no way to be spread.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    One example of such a disease is smallpox. Smallpox was thought to have been eradicated due to a movement by the World Health Organization in 1967. By 1980, smallpox was declared eradicated by the WHO. However, there are concerns that smallpox could return. The reasons behind the concerns are buried in the permafrost of Siberia. SIberia had a smallpox epidemic about 120 years ago, killing up to 40% of people in towns. Now, as the permafrost melts, the bodies buried there that had died due to smallpox may resurface and still harbor some pathogens. Bodies uncovered so far have not had any pathogens in them, but fragments of the DNA of smallpox has been found in the victim’s cells. This and rising popularity of the anti-vaccination movement, discussed later in this article, may cause smallpox to gain a foothold and cause another epidemic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Another example of a disease thought to have been eradicated by vaccines is polio. Polio is a disease affecting only humans as well. polio attacks the nervous system, causing headaches, fevers, etc. Sometimes, polio can even cause the permanent paralysis of limbs, muscles, lungs, and throat. Polio has nearly been eliminated completely with rates falling 99% since 1980 due to a vaccine. However, it is still a problem in some middle eastern countries including Pakistan and Afghanistan. Nigeria also had almost eradicated polio by 2015. Due to Nigeria still having some polio virus present, Somalia had two different outbreaks of polio.

                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                Why does the flu need a different vaccination every year? Shouldn’t it be vaccinated against once to gain immunity? The flu viruses must be vaccinated every year because the virus undergoes high mutation rates. This means that everytime the virus replicates, it usually has some genetic differences. This is like you having some differences from your parents, not being and identical mix of your two parents. However, since the virus replicates so quickly and at such high scales, it mutates more per replication. This means that it is more likely to mutate when it replicates. When it mutates, the virus may undergo a process called antigenic drift, in which the antigens on the surface of the virus also mutate. This means that the immune system no longer recognizes it and can no longer defend against it properly. Another process that may happen is antigenic shift. This process causes a large shift in the viruses genes from what the immune system can recognize, which can infect most people. Antigenic shifts are much rarer but can be more deadly, as they occur very quickly and cause a pandemic. To combat these shifts in the genes of the flu, you are given a new vaccination for the flu every year.

                                The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)epidemic is a large problem in many parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is caused by the HIV virus, which targets the Helper T Cells of the immune system. Helper T Cells activate the immune system’s response towards specific bacteria. Without the Helper T Cells, your body cannot defend well against infections, only being able to use defenses which it uses against all microbes - nonspecific defenses. When your immune system is compromised the condition is called AIDS. AIDS does not cause death, however since it weakens the immune system so much, microbes in your body take advantage of the missing immune system and can kill you.

                                There are a few reasons that the HIV virus is so hard to develop a vaccine for. Other than attributes that many viruses share such as frequent mutation, there are a few special reasons why HIV is so hard to develop vaccines for. The first reason is that the HIV virus targets the immune system’s cells and the vaccines are useless without an immune system. This is also a problem because the immune system’s cells may get infected before it even realizes that HIV is in the cells. The second reason why it is so hard to develop vaccines for HIV is that it is a retrovirus. Retroviruses bury themselves into the DNA of the infected cell. In HIV’s case, it infects all of the helper T cells and inserts its own DNA into the cell’s DNA. When the cell replicates, the viral DNA is replicated with it. This means that most of your immune system cells can become infected with HIV without any symptoms. Then, HIV activates by hijacking the cell to produce its own viral components and assemble them. The trigger to this action is still unknown, which is another problem. Retroviruses such as HIV may stay in the body for 20 or more years before a trigger is activated. This means that during those 20 years, the virus can be passed on through bodily fluids to another person. This is why the HIV virus is so deadly too. The third reason is that there is no natural immunity from HIV. This means that once the body is infected by HIV, there is no way to respond to it and the body will never develop an immunity to it like other diseases such as the flu and smallpox.

                            <p>Laws were created to make taking vaccinations mandatory for small children, and also to enforce public safety. </p>
                            <p>The public opinion of vaccinations had changed by the 1970s again. There was a controversy over immunizations for Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis from a hospital in the United Kingdom. This was centered around children getting conditions involving the nervous system. Although an investigation revealed that the vaccinations were completely safe, the public was still not convinced. This was in part due to different people in the medical professions having mixed opinions about vaccinations. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Just about 3 decades later, in 1998, another controversy arose, this time about the vaccine for Mumps, Measles, and Rubella. There were allegations of the vaccine causing autism or other diseases. Andrew Wakefield, a doctor from the UK was at the center of these claims. It was later found out that he had been bribed to say such things to support a family’s claim in a lawsuit.
                            </p>
                            <p>More recently campaigns to remove a compound containing small amount of mercury from vaccinations has arose. Thimerosal was blamed for causing autism due to it containing some mercury. It was highlighted when vaccine manufacturers started to lower the amount used due to some concerns, just to be safe. Even though statements have been made that Thimerosal is safe, the public was not assured.

                            <p>You may be wondering how if a few people don’t take vaccinations, then what could happen to affect you? Herd Immunity is how more people can be protected even if they aren’t vaccinated. If most of the population is vaccinated against a disease, it will be harder for the disease to spread to those that are not vaccinated, as they will statistically be more spread out and harder to find. However, decreasing the percent of the population that is vaccinated makes it much easier for the disease to jump from person to person, and in rarer cases mutate to be able to infect vaccinated people too. However, due in part to social media, “anti-vaxxers” refuse to vaccinate themselves even with vaccinations that do not contain mercury compounds or are proven not to cause mental disorders.</p>

                            <p>In conclusion, you can see that vaccines enabled humanity to develop strongly into the much safer world today. It allowed us to successfully pass the filthy industrial revolution stage, and allows us to live till much older ages than before. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has been a major problem for many countries, but vaccines still can be developed. However, the anti-vaccination movement could put the lives of many people at risk, and decrease life expectancy in those communities.</p>
